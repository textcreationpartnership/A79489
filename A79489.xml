         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOur former Treatiſe (intituled, <hi>The vanitie of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Baptiſme</hi>) being anſwered, I (according to my promiſe made unto you in that anſwer<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 28. lin. 31, 32.</note>) doe now proceed to anſwer this your other Treatiſe (which you have intituled, <hi>The ſecond part of the vanitie and Childiſhnes of Infants Baptiſme.</hi>) And (I conceive) it is the Treatiſe whereof you ſpake in your <hi>vanitie of Childiſh Baptiſme</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 29. lin. 30, 31, 32.</note>, wherein you ſay, that <hi>the grounds which Seperates and ſome others urge for the baptizing of Infants, ſhould be anſwered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here (in the beginning of this your ſecond part) you ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Having formerly treated of the Baptiſme of the nationall Church,</hi> you <hi>have now thought it meet likewiſe to conſider the grounds upon which the ſeperated, and ſome other Churches doe baptize their Infants, which</hi> (you ſay) <hi>are from ſeverall places of Scripture.</hi> But in anſwer to your firſt Treatiſe (<hi>pag.</hi> 27. <hi>line</hi> 26, 27, 28, 29.) I there tell you, that theſe [ſome others] beſides <hi>Seperates,</hi> I know not who they are, and if they are not ſeperated from the unclean thing, they are ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:111072:3"/>
            <p>And though ſuch may bring good grounds for baptizing of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> from ſeverall places of Scripture; yet they cannot bring good grounds to warrant any <hi>Churches</hi> to baptize, that are not ſeperated from Idolatry, and doe not cleave unto <hi>Christ</hi> in puritie, in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible way of worſhip.</p>
            <p>But thoſe that are ſo ſeperated indeed, may [very juſtly] alledge Scripture to juſtifie what they do in things of this nature, for of all <hi>Churches</hi> and people in the world, they are the moſt holy and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, yea and cleave cloſeſt to the <hi>Rule.</hi> And they in baptizing their <hi>Infants,</hi> do that whereunto they are bound by the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which both they and their holy <hi>ſeed</hi> are under.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſay, the <hi>grounds are from ſeverall places of Scripture, eſpecially theſe five, which you promiſe to examine in order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer; I know not what five you meane, for you have not ſo plainly diſtinguiſhed them, whereby wee may know how (in your book) to find them. But (it may be) you have not done it of ſet purpoſe, but through ſome over-ſight; for (in <hi>pag.</hi> 3. <hi>li.</hi> 16.) you ſpeak of <hi>a ſecond [argument] from [places]</hi> and (in <hi>pag</hi> 3. <hi>lin.</hi> 39.) you ſpeak of <hi>a third [argument]</hi> (from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14) The fourth (in <hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>lin.</hi> 40.) is expreſſed to be <hi>the fourth Scripture.</hi> As (in <hi>pag.</hi> 1.) <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. is declared to be <hi>the firſt.</hi> But (in <hi>pag.</hi> 18. <hi>lin.</hi> 2.) you ſpeake of <hi>a fifth [argument.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by this your diſorderly manner of proceeding, it appeares that you doe not performe what you promiſed (in <hi>pag.</hi> 1.) where you ſay, <hi>the grounds are from ſeverall places of [Scripture] eſpecially the [five,] which you there promiſe to examine in order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt (you ſay) is that in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is to you and your children.</hi> But <hi>this Text</hi> (you ſay) <hi>is to no purpoſe in the poynt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, that this your bare affirmation will not beare the leaſt weight in the ballance of <hi>Gods</hi> Sanctuary: for this <hi>promiſe</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> is the promiſe of <hi>eternall life,</hi> and all thoſe who are <hi>heires</hi> of this promiſe, are the right <hi>Subjects of Baptiſme</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 10.47.</note>. But the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> of <hi>beleevers</hi> are <hi>heires</hi> of this promiſe; for ſo the tener of the whole <hi>Scripture</hi> declareth: There is no place of <hi>Scripture</hi> which deſcribeth the bleſſedneſſe of the <hi>parents,</hi> but it alſo includeth their <hi>Infants;</hi> yea in this place <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. where <hi>beleevers children</hi> are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111072:3"/> mentioned, <hi>their Infants</hi> are meant. As ſhall be more clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in anſwer to your next objections following. And this being prooved, it followeth that they are the right ſubjects of <hi>Baptiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you ſay, <hi>it is not there ſaid of Infants, but to your Children, not promiſes, but promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, that this your Anſwer is of no weight, for <hi>Infants</hi> are <hi>Children</hi> as well being <hi>young</hi> as <hi>old,</hi> and this great <hi>promiſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> includeth <hi>promiſes:</hi> for though <hi>Gods</hi> great promiſe (in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) be but <hi>one,</hi> yet in particular it is <hi>divers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſeeing you ſay, <hi>it is worthy enquiry to know what is meant by you and your Children,</hi> I will (by Gods aſſiſtance) prove unto you, that it is meant of <hi>beleevers</hi> and <hi>their Infants.</hi> Conſider therefore that the Apoſtle doth not onely diſtinguiſh them from their <hi>parents,</hi> by the title <hi>Children,</hi> and alſo from <hi>thoſe afar off;</hi> But he likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth them to be thoſe <hi>children</hi> to whom the <hi>promiſe</hi> appertaineth as well as to the <hi>parents</hi> themſelves: which doth plainly ſhew that it ought not to be underſtood, as if it were ſpoken of [all] their <hi>Children</hi> (both <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi>) but of all thoſe <hi>Children</hi> who doe not degenerate from the ſteps of their <hi>holy parents;</hi> which <hi>ſinne</hi> of <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> (or <hi>degeneration</hi>) you cannot juſtly lay to the charge of beleevers <hi>Infants,</hi> who never ſinned actually<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Spilsbury</hi> ſayth, the word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demns none, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to actuall ſinne. See his Treat. of <hi>Bap. pag.</hi> 11 <hi>lin.</hi> 30.</note>: It is a ſure truth, that the ſinnes of the <hi>parents</hi> being forgiven, the Lord will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the ſame unto their <hi>Infants</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Sinne remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, unleſſe it be acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</note>. Originall ſinne (I ſay) taketh no more hold on the <hi>Infants,</hi> then on their <hi>parents,</hi> and touching <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinne,</hi> they are as cleare as their <hi>parents</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 20.6.</note>. But the like cannot be ſaid of [all] their <hi>children</hi> of ripe yeares<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 18.10, 11, 12, 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it plainly appeareth, that the <hi>promiſe</hi> is made <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> to all the <hi>infants</hi> of the <hi>faithfull,</hi> howbeit not to all their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> but onely to ſuch as abide in the ſteps of their <hi>righteous parents,</hi> amongſt which holy <hi>children,</hi> the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>beleeving parents</hi> are not the ſmalleſt number.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, that there might be <hi>infants</hi> there; for who ſhould controle (or forbid) the <hi>parents</hi> from keeping their owne <hi>Children,</hi> as well in <hi>infancie,</hi> as after?</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſay, your <hi>Negative is as good as their Affirmative;</hi> What affirmative doe you mean? and who are the perſons you here intend? If you meane the bare <hi>concluſion</hi> from <hi>infants</hi> being <hi>in the houſhold,</hi> that therefore <hi>infants may be baptized;</hi> I think ſuch an <hi>Affirmative</hi> is ſomewhat like your <hi>Negative,</hi> though it be not the ſame; but peradventure thoſe <hi>[ſome others]</hi> you mention beſides <hi>Seperates,</hi> were the authors hereof.</p>
            <p>But to make your <hi>Negative as good [and more probable]</hi> then <hi>their Affirmative,</hi> which you ſay is <hi>without any proofe,</hi> you adde theſe words, <hi>For it is ſaid,</hi> Act. 18 8. <hi>That Criſpus the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue, beleeved on the Lord, with all his houſhold, and that many of the Corinthians hearing it, beleeved and were baptized.</hi> And it is ſaid of the <hi>Gaoler,</hi> who was baptized and all his, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.32. <hi>That Paul and Sylas firſt preached the Word unto him, and to all that were in his houſe.</hi> And in the 33. verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>that he with all his houſhold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in God.

            <p>To which I anſwer, that all this which you have here rehearſed, doth not prove the thing for which you brought it (to wit) that your <hi>Negative is as good and more probable then their Affirmative;</hi> I pray you, tell me, Doth any of theſe Scriptures tell you that <hi>there was no</hi> Infants <hi>in theſe</hi> families? or that (according to your former Concluſion) it is more probable, <hi>there was none, then that there was any?</hi> Surely ſuch a thing cannot be gathered from any tittle of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or neceſſary conſequence therefrom; neither doe theſe <hi>Scriptures,</hi> alledged by you, nor your following Concluſion from thence, which you have here ſet downe, contradict the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of <hi>Infants</hi> in the leaſt, wherfore it will not ſerve your turne, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate what you have ſaid before in oppoſition of the truth.</p>
            <p>That which we ought ſeriouſly to minde, is that the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>beleeving parents,</hi> are <hi>bleſſed</hi> with their <hi>faithfull parents</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To which I <hi>Anſ.</hi> That <hi>beleevers children</hi> are in the <hi>covenant,</hi> is true; but that [all] the <hi>childeren</hi> of [all] <hi>beleevers</hi> are in the <hi>covenant,</hi> is not true, but all their holy <hi>infants</hi> are, and ought ſo to be judged, &amp; accounted euen in the ſtate of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> as wel as the greateſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball profeſſors of the <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all theſe <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving parents</hi> that live till they come to yeares of diſcretion, are ſtill to be acounted <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> except they <hi>apoſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though the Scripture declareth that a <hi>remnant</hi> ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet we are directed, by the rule of Gods Word, to judge, that beleeving parents, and their ſeed that doe not degenerate, are of this remnant. But the childeren of beleevers in their infancie have not power actually to degenerate from the righteous ſteps of their holy parents. But <hi>ould childeren</hi> may poſſibly. So <hi>Iſhmael</hi> [when he was an <hi>infant</hi>] was not a mocker neither was <hi>Cain</hi> [in his infancie] a murtherer: but when they came to yeares, and acted theſe wickedneſſes, they were for the ſame caſt out, the one from communion with the familie of <hi>Adam</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 4.11.14.16.</note>; the other from the familie of <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 21.9.10.</note>.</p>
            <p>And as you reaſon here againſt <hi>beleevers infants</hi> being in the new Covenant, becauſe you know not abſolutely whether they ſhall be ſaved. So you may reaſon againſt the <hi>parents</hi> themſelves, though they are <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> and alſo as well plead againſt every verball profeſſor, that is, a viſible <hi>member</hi> of the ſame body.</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>All you which ſeem to be beleevers, are a people which have indeed taken upon you the profeſſion of the great name of God, and have given up your ſelves unto him, to walke in all his wayes,</hi> and ſay, <hi>you have taken hold of Gods Covenant, and have covenanted together to become an entire body, City, Houſe, Temple, Garden, Vineyard, &amp;c. unto God, whom you ſuppoſe to be your builder and planter, &amp;c. So you thinke your ſelves to be his holy people, his bride by marriage, his peculiar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in covenant with him, &amp;c, But alas! you are much deceived, you thinke your ſelves to be in a holy and happie eſtate, in Covenant with God, and that you have right to his Ordinances, but it is not ſo.</hi> For, then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111072:16"/> it will follow, <hi>That if you beleevers [members of this viſible Church] be in the Covenant, and have this true holineſſe, then every member of you muſt be ſaved as well old as young,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But all the members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church are not ſaved [no, not of the Chriſtian Church in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time, for divers of them periſhed, as</hi> Judas Iſcareot, [<hi>one of the Lambs</hi> 12 <hi>Apoſtles</hi>] and <hi>Simon Magus:</hi> Therfore, though you profeſs faith, you are not in the Covenant now on foot, nor ought to be baptiſed.</p>
            <p>If this be a good and ſufficient ground, or reaſon, to prove the parents not to be in the new Covenant, nor to be baptized, then the ſame reaſon is of force, againſt the <hi>infants</hi> of beleevers, to prove them alſo not to be in the new <hi>Covenant,</hi> nor to be <hi>baptized.</hi> But this is very weak, againſt ſuch <hi>parents,</hi> Therefore it is of no force, againſt their <hi>infants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing it is ſo, you may plainly perceive that I have juſt ground to except againſt your concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Pag. 4 l. 22, 23</note> that becauſe all the children of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are not ſaved, Therefore the infants of beleevers are not in the Covenant now on foot, nor ought to be baptized.</p>
            <p>Such an excuſe as this might as well have ſerved informer time for the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they might not onely have negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> but alſo, all other <hi>Ordinances:</hi> But ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bringeth <hi>large liberty</hi> tending to <hi>Athiſme, deſtruction,</hi> and ruination of the <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>

            <p>And as <hi>faith</hi> gave <hi>Abraham</hi> the denomination of Gods friend, (the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of which faith, <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was a <hi>ſeal</hi>

            <p>But concerning the <hi>infants</hi> of the <hi>Proſolytes,</hi> there was no queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, they were to be <hi>circumciſed</hi> (being in the <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with their <hi>parents,</hi>) and yet not <hi>circumciſed</hi> becauſe they were their <hi>childeren</hi> by <hi>nature,</hi> but becauſe they were in the ſame <hi>covenant</hi> with their <hi>holy parents,</hi> and ſo they were the <hi>childeren</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>free Grace.</hi>

            <p>Now let us conſider, that if the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers,</hi> (members of the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi>) were not then <hi>aliens from the Common wealth of Iſrael,</hi> nor <hi>without hope,</hi> nor <hi>without God in the world.</hi> They were not then <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> neither were they <hi>Strangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Promiſe</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note>.</p>
            <p>But the Infants of beleevers (who were <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi>) were not <hi>aliens from the Common wealth of Iſrael</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Therefore ſuch holy <hi>Infants</hi> were not then without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they <hi>ſtrangers</hi> from the <hi>covenants of promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, for as much as the</hi> Infants <hi>of</hi> beleevers <hi>were not without</hi> Chriſt, nor <hi>aliens from the Common wealth of Iſrael,</hi> nor ſtrangers <hi>from the</hi> Covenants <hi>of</hi> promiſe, <hi>nor without hope,</hi> nor <hi>without God in the world.</hi> They were ſuch as were made <hi>nigh by the bloud of Chriſt</hi>

And therefore [ſeeing the <hi>New Covenant</hi> is not aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed] it evidently appeareth that the <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers</hi> now are in the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers</hi> were in the ſame <hi>New Covenant</hi> before. And this agreeth with the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. <hi>Elſe were your children uncleane, but now are they holy;</hi> for the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> there ſpeaketh to <hi>beleevers,</hi> and of a <hi>holineſſe</hi> in relation to their <hi>faith,</hi> and to the <hi>covenant</hi> they were in.</p>

            <p>Thus having taken away the foundation of your <hi>Arguments</hi> which you brought (againſt <hi>holy Infants</hi> being in the <hi>Covenant</hi>) you may juſtly expect, that all which is builded upon the ſame <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy foundation,</hi> will fall to the ground.</p>

(who were not then <hi>ſanctified</hi> to <hi>beleevers</hi> for that purpoſe) you even looſe your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But you ſay, it <hi>is a contradiction in one and the ſelfe-ſame reſpects,</hi> and have not explaned nor declared what it is a <hi>contradiction</hi> of; whether of the <hi>New covenant,</hi> or of the <hi>old covenant,</hi> or of both <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants:</hi> Therefore declare plainly, what <hi>covenant</hi> you thinke this divorcement in <hi>Ezra</hi> to be an effect of? Was it an effect of the <hi>New covenant,</hi> or of <hi>the old?</hi> you may know, that neither <hi>covenants</hi> did allow them to marry thoſe curſed perſons. You ought alſo to minde, that one <hi>Iſraelite</hi> might be divorced from another <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> in the time of the Law; and this precept was granted and written them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (Deut. 24.1.) <hi>for the hardnes of their hearts,</hi> (Mat. 10.5.) But this (in <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.) was not a bare grant, but an abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; not barely permitted (or granted) unto them, <hi>for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:111072:23"/> of their hearts,</hi> there is more in it then ſo. For thoſe wicked perſons in whom they formerly took delight, they were forceably to put away, &amp; it was not left to their libertie, whether they would put them away or no, but it was an injunction layd upon them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der penaltie of <hi>Gods curſe;</hi> for they perceived Gods heavie wrath was hanging over their heads, ready to ſeaze upon them, unleſſe there were ſome ſpeedy redreſſe.</p>
            <p>And it evidently appeareth, that you have not well read (or conſidered) the Scripture, for if you had, you would ſoone have ſeen a great and weightie reaſon, preſſing theſe ſonnes of God to put away theſe daughters of men, and thoſe <hi>unholy children</hi> borne of them, for they (in uniting themſelvs thus unto them) had made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves one with them; yea, they had made themſelves one with the abhominable Nations (as appeareth by <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.1 compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.26.) <hi>An accurſed thing, like the accurſed thing; And did not ſeperate themſelves from the people of theſe Lands, doing according to their abhominations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore there was a ſpeciall cauſe why the <hi>children</hi> of thoſe <hi>Idolaters,</hi> (in <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10.3.) ſhould be put away, They were not <hi>viſibly holy;</hi> the <hi>wives</hi> were not <hi>ſanctified</hi> unto them, to bring forth a <hi>viſible holy ſeed. The holy ſeed was mixed:</hi> But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith to the <hi>beleevers,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 13, 14, 15. <hi>That the unbeleeving husband is ſanctified by the wife, and the unbeleeving wife is ſanctified by the husband; Elſe were your children uncleane, but now are they holy. But if the unbeleeving depart, let him depart. A brother or a ſiſter is not under bondage in ſuch caſes, but God hath called us to peace.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>But your ſpeech, (in charitie) may have this conſtruction, That <hi>ſeeing the Lord did command the Proſolyte to circumciſe his male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that very command did intimate that his female children were in the Covenant, and according to their capabilitie to aſſent to Gods ordinance, that it was good &amp; holy, though they were not to receive it, yet had a right to whatſoever came in ſtead thereof.</hi> And this beeing not to be <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> by them <hi>actively,</hi> it muſt needs be conſtrued that they were <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed imputatively:</hi> This then was a great <hi>priviledge;</hi> for without this <hi>imputative holineſſe,</hi> they could not be numbered<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 4 3.</note> among the <hi>living</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but rather counted among the <hi>uncircumciſed Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtians,</hi> neither could they without this imputativeneſſe be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to receive the <hi>Lords Paſſeover</hi>

            <p>But from hence you collect a ſuppoſition, and upon your ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition you ground a poſition, Your poſition is, <hi>That if the Jewes Church ſtate (from whence</hi> (you would have us take notice that you ſay) <hi>this ſucceſſion and beeing in the covenant is derived) doth not admit in any conſideration of any lawfull beeing of parents, the one a member of the Church, the other not to produce a ſeed within the old Covenant,</hi> your poſition (grounded upon this ſuppoſition) is, <hi>that then ſuch a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new Covenant, cannot be concluded to proceed from that rule.</hi>

            <p>Now, it would be knowne, what you meane by <hi>parents,</hi> whether you meane any <hi>parents</hi> whatſoever! or but ſome onely; for it doth not follow, that becauſe ſome were not admitted, that <hi>therefore no unbeleevers were allowed to abide with their beleeving yoak-fellowes, for producing of a holy ſeed in Covenant.</hi>

            <p>Now I conceive, that if any of the <hi>Proſolytes daughters</hi> at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in, did refuſe to come in, ſhee could not be compelled vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, but was ſtill, as ſhee remained ſo to be eſteemed without, and numbered not amongſt the living in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but the dead in <hi>Paleſtina.</hi> And therefore by the ſame rule, if any of his <hi>male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> (who were at yeares of diſcretion) would not be content to come in with his <hi>father,</hi> as his <hi>father</hi> was to reckon him among the <hi>uncircumciſed,</hi> ſo was he not to <hi>circumciſe</hi> him, nor compell him to be <hi>circumciſed,</hi> till he ſubmitted voluntarily; yet if this <hi>Proſolyte</hi> had male <hi>infants,</hi> borne of her that was <hi>ſanctified</hi> to him, though ſhe did not <hi>ſanctifie</hi> him, he was to <hi>circumciſe</hi> them, and to rank his <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>And it is further to be minded, that <hi>viſible Saints,</hi> who make a <hi>verball profeſſion,</hi> and walke <hi>holily</hi> in outward appearance, though we cannot infallibly tell whether they have <hi>faith</hi> or no, they are to be <hi>baptized,</hi> And we are not to dreame that wee can diſcerne inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in men, ſeeing <hi>God</hi> only knoweth the <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man that is in him;</hi> yet where we ſee a <hi>holy verball profeſſion,</hi> and a <hi>life</hi> and converſation annexed thereunto, and correſpondent therewith, <hi>outwardly,</hi> though <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward qualifications</hi> be not according to the requiring of the <hi>Word,</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, Wee are to note from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words, <hi>Elſe were your children uncleane, but now are they holy:</hi> That becauſe the <hi>unbeleeving

            <p>Fourthly, We are to take notice that the cauſe of the <hi>ſanctification</hi> of the <hi>unbeleeving wives</hi> (or that which made them to be ſo <hi>ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>) was two things.</p>
            <p>Friſt, Their abiding.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, Becauſe their <hi>yoak-fellowes</hi> were <hi>beleevers,</hi> if her <hi>yoak-fellow</hi> be a <hi>beleever</hi> elſe ſhe cannot be ſo <hi>ſanctified</hi> to the <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> for that that is not, cannot be ſaid to be.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtle</hi> treateth of <hi>holineſſe;</hi> which wee are to take for that excellent <hi>ſpirituall holineſſe,</hi> which becometh the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> even ſuch a <hi>holineſſe</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>infants</hi> had.

The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and doth no way leſſon it, and therefore conſidering what the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>bel evers</hi> have been, &amp; what Chriſt hath done for them, wee may well underſtand that the <hi>holineſſe</hi> which they have now, is a <hi>holin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, It evidently appeareth from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words, that wee may ſafely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that ſuch <hi>children</hi> (ſpoken of here) are different from <hi>heathens;</hi> for the <hi>unbeleeving wife</hi> had not that priviledge to bring forth ſuch a <hi>holy ſeed</hi> unto a heathen. And ſo the like may be ſaid for the <hi>unbeleeving husband,</hi> that he could not beget a <hi>holy ſeed</hi> of her that was an <hi>unbeleeving wife,</hi> but it is peculiarly bound up in the <hi>beleeving yok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Seventhly, If the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had ſaid to the <hi>beleevers,</hi> that their <hi>children</hi> were <hi>unholy,</hi> nevertheleſſe, you might ſtill have made ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> All which you have ſayd here, maketh nothing for your purpoſe, for <hi>vindication, illuſtration,</hi> or <hi>confirmation</hi> of your ſtrange <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> words; but rather maketh againſt you, for as much as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> deſireth every <hi>beleever</hi> to abide in the ſame calling wherein he was <hi>called.</hi> So that the <hi>beleeving married</hi> perſons had no need to put <hi>away</hi> their <hi>unbeleeving yoak-fellowes,</hi> for as much as the <hi>Lord</hi> allowed them to abide together, and that the <hi>unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yoak-fellowes</hi> were ſo <hi>ſanctified</hi> for producing a <hi>holy ſeed; Elſe were your children uncleane,</hi> (ſayth the <hi>Apoſtle) but now are they holy.</hi> But you pretend that you gathered your interpretation <hi>(Elſe were your children Baſtards, &amp;c.) from the generall ſcope of the Apoſtle in the</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>verſes following of the ſame Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words therefore I will repeat at large, becauſe you ſhall ſee that here is nothing in theſe <hi>verſes,</hi> which you pretend, or by which you have any occaſion to urge what you doe.</p>
            <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Let every man abide in the ſame calling wherein he was called.</hi> Ver. 21. <hi>Art thou called being a ſervant, care not for it? but if thou mayeſt be made free, uſe it rather.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>For he that is called in the Lord, being a ſervant, is the Lords freeman: Likewiſe alſo he that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led being free, is Chriſts ſervant.</hi> Ver. 23. <hi>Yee are bought with a price, be not yee the ſervants of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſider what ground you had to build ſuch an affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in ſpeaking of <hi>holineſſe,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>doth not meane a holineſſe in relation to faith,</hi> and that where he ſayth, <hi>Elſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:111072:39"/> were your children uncleane, but now are they holy;</hi> he meaneth, elſe were your children baſtards, but now are they no baſtards!</p>
            <p>What title of Scripture is here to warrant theſe your vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, in thus oppoſing <hi>holy infants?</hi> Or upon what <hi>reaſon</hi> doe you ground theſe <hi>unreaſonable collections?</hi> Is it becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayth, that the <hi>called of the Lord,</hi> are <hi>the Lords freemen,</hi> the <hi>Lords ſervants,</hi> &amp; <hi>are bought with a price?</hi> Surely, this maketh nothing againſt <hi>holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> being in <hi>Covenant;</hi> for they are bought with the ſame price. Chriſt came not to damnifie them, but to dignifie them; not to make them looſers, but gainers. And all this is wrought by him, in whom is all <hi>fullneſſe,</hi> and no <hi>emptineſſe; riches</hi> and no <hi>povertie; life,</hi> and no <hi>death;</hi> He it is that came to give himſelfe a <hi>ranſome</hi> for them.</p>
            <p>But you would inferre, that becauſe <hi>beleevers</hi> are exhorted by <hi>Paul</hi> to performe their <hi>civill Covenants,</hi> and <hi>lawfull Contracts</hi> which they have made with men, that therfore it appeareth that the gloſs which you gave upon the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. is a true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. What weight is in your words? let any one that hath ſence and reaſon judge; For the like might have been objected in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> againſt the <hi>infants</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> then, whom the Lord did call and ſanctifie, and cauſe to approach neere unto him; that becauſe the <hi>parents,</hi> and others, were to performe their <hi>Conditions</hi> and <hi>bargains,</hi> which they made each with other (or with <hi>ſtrangers</hi>) not changing,<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.4.</note> or going from their word, though it were to their hindrance, that therefore their <hi>holy infants</hi> then had no more <hi>holineſſe</hi> then a meer <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, That it is not ſufficient to ſay, that the <hi>reaſon is grounded upon a miſtake,</hi> unleſſe it be ſo, which if it be not ſo, then you are miſtaken your ſelfe (and that greatly) both in the <hi>reaſon,</hi> and in the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> alſo, in charging us with a great miſtake, when it is not grounded upon any miſtake, much leſſe upon a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and leaſt of all upon a great miſtake of the ſenſe of the Text, as you unjuſtly ſpeake; and therefore your charge is but a treble evill ſurmiſe, a meer ſuppoſition of that which is not; and this may evidently appeare to be true, becauſe out of <hi>Chriſts</hi> owne words, wee may gather that the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>heaven</hi> belongeth to the <hi>holy Infants; for,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdome of heaven.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Yea, It is true Chriſt as he was God, knew all things, &amp; therfore he (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be elected) ſaith in particular, Of them is the kingdom, &amp;c. But
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:111072:51"/> it doth not follow, that therefore ſuch as they are of it, and therfore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, that any other beleevers infants are of the kingdome of heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them.</hi> But heer you may ſee, that this blocketh up your <hi>objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> conſidering that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayth, <hi>Of [ſuch] is the kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> And that the word <hi>[ſuch]</hi> is of a larger extent, then the word <hi>[them]</hi> and includeth <hi>them</hi> alſo, as hath been obſerved before.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If the next words after (both in <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.) doe confirme the former, (as you confeſſe,) then it ſtill argueth, that the reaſon is <hi>invincible;</hi> and therefore neither you, nor all the men in the world, can overthrow it. It was firme <hi>before,</hi> and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (by your own <hi>confeſſion) confirmed</hi> in the next words <hi>after,</hi> then it is not <hi>contradicted</hi> there, as you have <hi>contradicted</hi> it here, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>judge</hi> your ſelfe, whether you have not beſtowed <hi>labour in vaine,</hi> in thus oppoſing <hi>holy Infants.</hi> For theſe Texts doe prove ſtill, that as <hi>infants</hi> are of the <hi>kingdome,</hi> ſo they are not deſtitute of the <hi>graces</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> without which none are <hi>capable Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> Wherefore heer is ſufficient demonſtration of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants converſion, humiliation, regeneration, and great eſtimation,</hi> which they have with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>word</hi> is to be taken, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, it being <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> and ſo directly oppoſed to your <hi>erronious affirmations,</hi> that it quite <hi>overthroweth</hi> your <hi>unſound collections,</hi> in your <hi>violent oppoſition</hi> of <hi>holy infants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, You ſpeake <hi>very untruly,</hi> and doe <hi>abuſe</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> exceedingly, by inferring from the <hi>premiſes,</hi> That when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayth, <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdome of heaven, His meaning is not of them, nor of ſuch as them in age nor underſtanding.</hi> For <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he <hi>ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of them,</hi> ſo he <hi>meaneth them,</hi> (though he doe not ſhut out <hi>aged</hi> perſons, that are in reſpect of <hi>holineſſe,</hi> ſuch as thoſe <hi>holy infants</hi> then were, or ſuch as theſe <hi>holy infants</hi> now are) and he <hi>meaneth [ſuch] properly,</hi> both in <hi>yeares &amp; underſtanding</hi> as may appeare by the ſcope of the place, where it is ſayd, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded to ſuffer them to come unto him; and declareth the reaſon (namely) becauſe they are <hi>Subjects</hi> of his <hi>kingdome;</hi> for <hi>of ſuch is the kingdome of heaven</hi> (ſayth he.) And when he cometh to teach a further leſſon, he applyeth it alſo to perſons of <hi>yeares,</hi> that they ſhould learne to receive the <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> like them, and to be <hi>converted,</hi> and to caſt away all <hi>pride,</hi> and to <hi>humble themſelves:</hi> All which <hi>graces</hi> (the <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi>) the <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers</hi> are not deſtitute of, for as much as they are <hi>regenerated,</hi> they have the <hi>ſeed,</hi> and beginning of all <hi>Chriſtian graces,</hi> as hath been proved before.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:111072:51"/>
            <p>Now, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> meaneth <hi>theſe infants,</hi> when he ſayth, <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdome,</hi> is <hi>cleare</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> and may partly appeare unto you from the former Conſiderations. But for further confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>premiſes,</hi> let us minde the ſcope of the <hi>place,</hi> and examine the <hi>Scriptures</hi> cited. In which is expreſly declared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That [the <hi>Infants</hi>] were [brought] unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Luk. 18.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The perſons <hi>intent</hi> in bringing them (or the <hi>reaſons</hi> why they brought them) was, <hi>[that Chriſt ſhould put his hands on them, and pray]</hi> Mat. 19.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaw that the <hi>Diſciples</hi> rebuked thoſe which brought them, <hi>he was [much] diſpleaſed,</hi> Mar. 10.13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, And he [called] them unto him,</hi> Luk. 18.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Wee are diſcreetly to obſerve, <hi>Chriſts</hi> two-fold <hi>charge,</hi> given unto his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> In theſe words, (1.) <hi>Suffer the [little] Children to come unto me,]</hi> (2.) <hi>[and forbid them not,]</hi> (Mar. 10.14.) Mat. 19.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Wee are, heedfully, to minde the <hi>reaſon,</hi> (which <hi>Chriſt</hi> rendereth for this) which is expreſſed, in theſe words, <hi>[For of ſuch is the kingdome of God,]</hi> Mar. 10.14. Luk. 18.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, Chriſts</hi> addition, or confirmation of his former ſpeech, or the uſe (which <hi>Chriſts Diſciples</hi> ſhould make concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) is not to be forgotten; <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall not receive the kingdome of God as a little childe, he ſhall in no wiſe enter therein,</hi> Mar. 10.15. Luk. 18.17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Wee are to minde <hi>Chriſts</hi> act to theſe <hi>Infants;</hi> which was three-fold; (1.) <hi>[He] took] them] up] in] his] armes,]</hi> and (2.) <hi>[Put] his] hands] upon them;]</hi> and (3.) <hi>[Bleſſed them,]</hi> Mat. 19.15. Mar. 10.16.</p>
            <p>All which doth give us ſufficient warrant to eſteeme highly of them, and of all thoſe who are like them in every reſpect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire you to weigh theſe things diſtinctly, and diſcreetly, and then, I hope, it will evidently appeare unto you, that you are miſtaken in your meaning, and have done very evill, (though you meant never ſo well) in ſaying that <hi>Chriſts meaning is not of them, nor of ſuch as them in age, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For indeed, you may as well ſay, that thoſe were not <hi>Infants</hi> whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> took up in his <hi>armes,</hi> and that he did not lay his <hi>hands</hi> upon them, nor <hi>bleſſed</hi> them, nor ſuch as them, in <hi>age,</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> But ſurely, if the <hi>Scripture</hi> in ſpeaking of <hi>ſuch</hi> perſons,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:111072:52"/> doe not exclude the perſons ſpoken of, then wee have no reaſon to exclude theſe <hi>infants</hi> here ſpecified, but to know that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who was once an <hi>infant,</hi> and like other <hi>infants,</hi> both in <hi>age,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">In reſpect of his <hi>humane nature.</hi>
               </note>, he includeth the <hi>infants,</hi> &amp; thoſe like unto them both in <hi>age</hi> and <hi>underſtanding;</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider how that the <hi>infants</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Not aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons like <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</hi>
               </note> were brought unto <hi>Chriſt;</hi> The intent of thoſe that brought them was <hi>good,</hi> and their act, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, was pleaſing unto <hi>God.</hi> The truth of this may appeare, by obſerving the declaration of their intention; and likewiſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> great diſpleaſure, or offence given by and taken at his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> becauſe <hi>they rebuked thoſe that brought them; He was much diſpleaſed</hi> (ſayth the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> by <hi>Mark,</hi> Mark. 10.13, 14.) which decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an <hi>agmentation,</hi> or <hi>aggravation</hi> of his <hi>diſpleaſure:</hi> The noting of which, maketh ſtill for clearing the caſe in controverſie; and may ſerve for further ſatisfaction of the doubting <hi>ſoule,</hi> that by <hi>Sathans</hi> deceit,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.11.</note> is apt to thinke, that this <hi>righteous ſervant through his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth not justifie many Infants,</hi> as well as others. <hi>Chriſts double charge</hi> unto his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> that the <hi>holy infants</hi> ſhould have free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and admittance unto him, without any let or hindrance, by any; and <hi>Chriſts</hi> forcible reaſon for it, (namely) <hi>for</hi> (or becauſe) <hi>of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven,</hi> &amp;c. And then, <hi>Chriſts acts</hi> concerning theſe <hi>infants,</hi> [that <hi>he took them up in his armes, and put his hands upon them, and bleſſed them</hi>] doth further declare, the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie</hi> of <hi>mine,</hi> (and the <hi>weakneſſe</hi> and <hi>inſufficiencie</hi> of <hi>your) interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, As without <hi>Chriſts minde,</hi> you have taken upon you to deliver <hi>Chriſts meaning,</hi> contrary to his owne <hi>expreſſions, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations,</hi> and <hi>commiſſions;</hi> ſo you cite, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your ſtrange reſtriction of <hi>Chriſts declaration</hi> concerning the <hi>Infants.</hi> As if <hi>Paul</hi> were a <hi>Patron</hi> of this your <hi>fond opinion;</hi> but I tell you, in this you are much deceived alſo, and doe erre (and as I in charitie judge) doe not know the Scriptures. It was no part of <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, to ſpeake of <hi>holy infants</hi> as you doe, he telleth us, they are <hi>holy</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor 7.14.</note>. And this his exhortation (in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20.) maketh nothing for you againſt <hi>holy infants;</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſpeake unto <hi>Infants,</hi> when he ſayth, <hi>Brethren, Be not children in underſtanding, howbeit, in malice be yee children, but in underſtanding be men.</hi> Now who knoweth not but that thoſe <hi>Saints,</hi> who are capable to act, are to performe acts of <hi>obedience</hi> unto <hi>God:</hi> when thoſe <hi>Saints,</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:111072:52"/> who are not capable to <hi>act,</hi> are not bounnd ſo to doe; For (as hath been declared before) <hi>God</hi> requireth <hi>actuall obedience</hi> of his <hi>people,</hi> [ſo far as they can <hi>act</hi>] &amp; no further; and ſo <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech is, not to binde us to <hi>impoſſibilies,</hi> but to teach us (who have <hi>capabilitie</hi>) to exerciſe the ſame, to the uttermoſt of our power, in ſearching after the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; in treaſuring up thoſe <hi>divine truths,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are taught us by his <hi>Spirit.</hi> And this maketh nothing againſt <hi>holy Infants</hi> being in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> or <hi>kingdome,</hi> no more then it maketh againſt thoſe aged <hi>Saints,</hi> who (in reſpect of a naturall capabilitie) are like <hi>children,</hi> and know no more then <hi>Infants know,</hi> nor doe no more then <hi>infants</hi> doe, and yet doe as much as God requireth; and in reſpect of a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall capabilitie,</hi> are like thoſe <hi>Saints,</hi> who are capable to act, &amp; doe act according to the ſame; and yet thoſe who want that capabilitie, whether <hi>Chriſtian infants,</hi> or other <hi>Saints,</hi> though the graces of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> doe not appeare in them, in the <hi>bloſſome,</hi> or <hi>fruit,</hi> yet have they ſtill the <hi>ſap,</hi> and <hi>ſeed</hi> of all <hi>Chriſtian graces</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>Even as a man, or childe, which hath not the <hi>uſe</hi> or <hi>exerciſe</hi> of reaſon, muſt not be judged to be an <hi>unreaſonable creature,</hi> &amp; wholly deſtitute of reaſon, but a <hi>reaſonable creature;</hi> So theſe <hi>(precious Saints)</hi> before ſpecified, though they have not the uſe and exerciſe of the <hi>graces</hi> of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> and cannot ſhew forth the ſame in the fruit, or outward manifeſtation, yet they are not to be eſteemed <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious</hi> (or deſtitute of <hi>Gods grace,</hi>) but <hi>gracious Saints.</hi> And though they be in <hi>underſtanding like children,</hi> yet (in reſpect of their <hi>capable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi>) they are to be eſteemed as <hi>precious</hi> as any men on earth, and wee are not to judge otherwiſe, but that they ſhall be <hi>glorified,</hi> and made equall with the <hi>Angels,</hi> and be the <hi>ſonnes</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now your citation of <hi>Pauls</hi> words (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. <hi>Be not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in underſtanding, &amp;c.</hi> to confirme what you inferred and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from <hi>Chriſts</hi> words concerning <hi>Infants,</hi>) doth imply, that you doe judge that all thoſe who are like thoſe <hi>Infants</hi> in <hi>yeares</hi> or <hi>underſtanding,</hi> are not of the <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>heaven.</hi> And this your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation bringeth in three abſurdities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It directly contradicteth <hi>Chriſts</hi> words which he ſpake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, and checketh him in his actions which he did to them, upon them, and for them; and ſo you make the words, and actions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both <hi>vaine</hi> and <hi>frivolous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Your ſpeech implyeth, that <hi>Beleevers infants</hi> are not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:111072:53"/> of the <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and ſo their minoritie hindereth their <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> (if they die in their <hi>infancie;</hi>) and this ſtriketh at the <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall principles</hi> of <hi>Gods free love</hi> unto them in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In (implying, that none are of the <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> who are <hi>like Infants</hi> in <hi>underſtanding,</hi>) Here I thinke you bring in a heavie cenſure againſt your ſelfe; for (I ſuppoſe) as you know not how ſoone your <hi>life</hi> ſhall be taken from you, the like you may ſay for your <hi>underſtanding;</hi> and when your <hi>underſtanding</hi> is taken away (which may be done, and yet you may live many yeares after) how doe you differ in <hi>underſtanding</hi> then from a <hi>childe;</hi> Surely you are then in underſtanding like a <hi>childe,</hi> little <hi>babe,</hi> or <hi>infant;</hi> and how then (by your owne <hi>expoſition</hi>) will you anſwer the <hi>Apostle, Be not children in underſtanding.</hi> Surely at the time when you will want both <hi>will, skill,</hi> and <hi>abilitie</hi> to <hi>act</hi> any more then they, what are you differing from them, and wherein will your underſtanding exceed theirs?</p>
            <p>Surely in conſideration of theſe things, you will grant, that old men, and others, that are the <hi>true Saints</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> may be <hi>like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> [in underſtanding] and yet not breake their <hi>Covenant.</hi> And in this declining or declined condition, an <hi>aged Saint</hi> may (in this reſpect) be ſayd to be as deſtitute of <hi>underſtanding,</hi> as the <hi>youngeſt babe</hi> of a <hi>beleeving parent.</hi> And he may be ſayd to be ſtill <hi>capable</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> (without being brought in any other <hi>covenant</hi> then he was in <hi>before</hi>) though he be not <hi>capable</hi> to [doe] any <hi>ſpirituall</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by way of manifeſtation, but <hi>God</hi> muſt doe all in him.</p>
            <p>Now though there be no difference between theſe two, in reſpect of <hi>ſpiritualitie,</hi> yet in ſome reſpects there is a difference; The <hi>Infant</hi> is [in nature] growing upwards, or in an inclining <hi>condition,</hi> &amp; hath the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian graces</hi> in him; the <hi>aged Saint</hi> before ſpecified, is in a declining condition; the <hi>leaves</hi> of the <hi>tree</hi> are <hi>fallen,</hi> no <hi>fruit</hi> appeareth, yet the <hi>ſpirituall ſap</hi> remaineth, &amp;c. And the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this doth teach us, not to deſpiſe any of the <hi>Lords veſſells,</hi> either the <hi>infants</hi> for their minoritie, or the old men for their <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,</hi> or the middle-aged for their <hi>bodily imbecilitie,</hi> but to eſteem of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they are, (according as the <hi>bleſſed ſpirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> doth teach us, in his <hi>ſacred Word</hi>) though through <hi>imperfection,</hi> or <hi>defection</hi> of <hi>naturall abilitie,</hi> they cannot <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>verbally manifeſt</hi> the <hi>fruits</hi> of their <hi>ſanctification,</hi> but are even as <hi>Children</hi> [in <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>].</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:111072:53"/>
            <p>By this glimpſe, you may ſee, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words (in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. when he exhorteth us, <hi>Not to be children in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>) will not beare out your <hi>childiſh conſtruction</hi> of the words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereby you would have us judge that he excluded <hi>infants;</hi> All which is evill in you ſo to think, much more to ſpeake, and worſt of all, in that you would boulſter up your opinions by <hi>Pauls</hi> words, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20! Which maketh nothing at all for your preſent purpoſe, in your <hi>reſtriction</hi> and <hi>miſ-application</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> words, where you thinke (through the help of <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20.) to get ſome advantage, or plea, to keep back the <hi>holy infants</hi> of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers</hi> from the <hi>ſpirituall bleſſings,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> hath teſtified appertaineth unto them, which you thinke did not appertaine to <hi>thoſe Infants,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt took up in his armes, and layd his hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bleſſed;</hi> And why doe you thus conceive? Becauſe it is ſayd of <hi>[ſuch]</hi> &amp; not of <hi>[them.]</hi> But this word <hi>ſuch,</hi> will evidently appear, (being duly weighed by the Scripture) to be of a <hi>larger</hi> extent then the word <hi>them,</hi> and ſo to include all <hi>them,</hi> eſpecially, conſidering that in all thoſe places of Scripture where the word <hi>ſuch</hi> is uſed, there is no exemption, either of the thing to which <hi>ſuch</hi> is <hi>equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> or coupled; for <hi>ſuch</hi> implyeth the ſame in <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Philemon (Philem</hi> 9, 10.) concerning <hi>Oneſſimus,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>Yet for loves ſake I rather beſeech thee, being [ſuch a one as Paul the aged.]</hi> He meaneth himſelfe: and when <hi>John</hi> ſayth, <hi>Bleſſed and happie is he that hath part in the firſt reſurrection; for on ſuch the ſecond death ſhall have no power, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 20.6.</note> He meaneth by <hi>[ſuch]</hi> thoſe perſons who have part in the <hi>firſt reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> The word <hi>[ſuch,]</hi> being a <hi>generall</hi> word, includeth them all. And when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſayth, (<hi>Nehe.</hi> 6.11.) <hi>Should [ſuch] a man as I fly;</hi> He meaneth himſelfe as much as any other man.</p>
            <p>And ſo when <hi>David</hi> ſayth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17, 18. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting, upon them that feare him, and his righteouſneſſe unto childrens children [unto ſuch as keep his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant]</hi> He meaneth thoſe that keep his <hi>Covenant,</hi> for this mercy was promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his <hi>ſeed;</hi> who were to <hi>keep</hi> his <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> by <hi>doing</hi> his <hi>commands.</hi> So <hi>God</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abraham, Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant, [Therefore] thou and thy ſeed, &amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Divers other <hi>teſtimonies</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> concerning <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> where this word <hi>ſuch</hi> is mentioned, might be produced, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> doth ſtill include, both the former &amp; the later, in the ſpecification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, But this may ſuffice, for <hi>in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every thing is eſtabliſhed.</hi> This ſtill giveth us more ground to beleeve that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> (in his <hi>Goſpel</hi>) ſayth (concerning <hi>infants) of ſuch is the kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> He meaneth thoſe who are <hi>ſuch</hi> in every reſpect; and as it is contrary to reaſon, ſo it is contrary to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to thinke that the <hi>infants</hi> in his ſpeech were not implyed &amp; included, if not principally intended.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Whereas you ſay, it is meant <hi>of ſuch as them in humilitie, and ſuch like qualifications;</hi> I know not from what conception you ground your ſpeech, if not from this conſideration, that the <hi>infants</hi> mentioned heer (in <hi>Christs Goſpel</hi>) have <hi>humilitie, and ſuch like qualifications;</hi> You ſhould know, that although <hi>like, is not</hi> alwayes <hi>the ſame, yet the ſame is the ſame,</hi> &amp; is as like unto it ſelfe, as that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is like it in every reſpect, and therfore <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſpeech of <hi>Infants,</hi> (when he ſayth, <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdome, &amp;c.</hi>) implyeth the <hi>infants</hi> [as well as other Saints, who are like them in underſtanding, though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in yeares.] I ſay, Chriſts ſpeech is not bound up from them, nor from any other Saints, though they are like them in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. And if they have <hi>humilitie,</hi> (according to your own grant) then you may know alſo that God will not reject them.

            <p>But <hi>holy infants</hi> being in the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>members,</hi> of the ſame, they are a <hi>glory</hi> unto it, and it may well be expected, (according to the ordinary courſe of nature) that they will out-live the other, and ſo ſucceed them after their deceaſe, and ſo the <hi>celeſtiall glorie</hi> of the <hi>fathers</hi> will ſhine in the <hi>children,</hi> (according to the minde of <hi>God</hi>) in this <hi>terreſtriall world.</hi>

            <p>Take notice heer, how the <hi>Lord</hi> comforted his <hi>people,</hi> and ſpake
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:111072:58"/> comfortably to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> And he is the ſame unto his <hi>people,</hi> as he hath been heretofore; His <hi>comfort</hi> is not leſſened, but is extended to all <hi>Saints,</hi> from the <hi>leaſt</hi> unto the <hi>greateſt,</hi> from the <hi>youngeſt</hi> to the <hi>eldeſt.</hi> God never leſſeneth his <hi>glorie</hi> nor his <hi>excellencie,</hi>

            <p>Seeing then it is ſo cleare, that the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers</hi> are the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the fathers houſe,</hi> they (being of his <hi>houſhold</hi>) muſt have the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> of the <hi>houſe,</hi> according to the appointment of the <hi>houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> and what is appointed for ſuch <hi>veſſells</hi> of <hi>honour,</hi> and of <hi>glory?</hi> Surely theſe <hi>holy veſſells</hi> of the <hi>Lords ſanctuary,</hi> they being <hi>beleevers,</hi> and <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> being <hi>hallowed</hi> by the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> ought to be <hi>baptized;</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, It is declared, what this <hi>glory</hi> is, and wherein this <hi>glory</hi> conſiſteth, or what muſt be put upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> what <hi>glorious things,</hi> even <hi>the off-ſpring, and the iſſue,</hi> (ſayth he) that is to ſay, their <hi>ſeed,</hi> or <hi>children;</hi> for they are the <hi>off-ſpring,</hi> and the <hi>iſſue,</hi> as may appeare by theſe Scriptures; [<hi>Job</hi> 5.25. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 48.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 61.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 65.23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.5, 6.] And this is according to what the <hi>Apostle</hi> declareth in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. that the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>beleevers, (male,</hi> or <hi>female,</hi>) the <hi>off-ſpring,</hi> and the <hi>iſſue,</hi> are a <hi>holy ſeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>off-ſpring,</hi> and <hi>iſſue,</hi> hath dependency upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and he beareth them, and will beare them,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> and <hi>bleſſe</hi> them in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and <hi>justifie</hi> them in <hi>bleſſing</hi> them, and <hi>ſanctifie</hi> them in <hi>juſtifying</hi> them, and <hi>glorifie</hi> them in <hi>ſanctifying</hi> them; He is all in all, in them, and for them, and to them; Their <hi>glory,</hi> is the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Fathers houſe,</hi> and they are the <hi>glory</hi> thereof, as hath been ſhewed before. Wherefore let all <hi>Chriſtian parents,</hi> as they love <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>procreation</hi> of their <hi>children,</hi> dedicate their <hi>holy off-ſpring,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed iſſue,</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> and lay them upon the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſay unto him, <hi>Save</hi> us <hi>thy people,</hi> (both <hi>great</hi> &amp; <hi>ſmall,</hi>

            <p>Eighthly, Further, this <hi>holy off-ſpring, and bleſſed iſſue,</hi> which is the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>houſe</hi> of the <hi>God</hi> of all <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> (who is the <hi>Father</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>) are called <hi>veſſells</hi> of <hi>ſmall quantitie; veſſells</hi> of <hi>ſmall quantie,</hi> are uſed to be ſet upon <hi>nayles</hi> ſometimes for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:111072:59"/> ſhow, for ſafetie and conveniencie, glory and decency. Now <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> is as a <hi>nayle, the off-ſpring, and the iſſue,</hi> are the <hi>veſſells of ſmall quantitie,</hi> and theſe <hi>holy veſſells</hi> of <hi>ſmall quantitie, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to <hi>beare;</hi> yea, and to beare them <hi>all, [all] veſſells of ſmall quantitie,</hi> (ſayth the Text.) Wherefore wee have no ground to caſt away any of them, or omit the leaſt of theſe <hi>veſſells,</hi> though they are but of <hi>[ſmall] quantitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some peradventure will think, that <hi>becauſe the infants of beleevers are veſſells of [ſmall] quantitie,</hi> that <hi>therefore they are [no veſſells,] or veſſels of [no] quantitie,</hi> or veſſels of contempt, or diſgrace, or ſuch in whom there is no <hi>glory ſpiritually,</hi> or ſuch concerning whom they cannot <hi>judge,</hi> or ſuch in whom the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Gods grace</hi> is not to be eſteemed to be. But let them know, that they doe <hi>violent injurie</hi> unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and doe exceedingly eclipſe the <hi>glorie</hi> of his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip;</hi> For as the <hi>ſmalleſt veſſells</hi> in the <hi>Lords Temple,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> were as <hi>holy</hi> as the <hi>greater,</hi> though they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſo much; So the <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers,</hi> (who are the <hi>Lords veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells</hi>) are as <hi>holy,</hi> as thoſe <hi>Saints</hi> who are paſt their minoritie, though they being <hi>Infants,</hi> through tendernes of yeares, cannot containe, or receive, what the others (who are aged) can; yet are they as precious in <hi>Chriſts</hi> eſtimation, and have his <hi>holineſſe</hi> upon them, as aged Saints have. There was a great difference<note n="*" place="margin">They differed in the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not in the qualitie. Zach. 4.20.</note>, in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> between the <hi>ſpoones, flaggons,</hi> and <hi>cups,</hi> in the <hi>Temple;</hi> and the <hi>cenſers, ſeas,</hi> and <hi>potts:</hi> and yet they were all holy, both <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ſmall:</hi> and ſo were the <hi>Jewes,</hi> both <hi>young</hi> and <hi>old, great</hi> and <hi>ſmall, Infants</hi> and <hi>aged perſons</hi> they were all <hi>holy</hi> eccleſiaſtically, and all the <hi>Lords holy veſſels;</hi> and we are not to have ſuch <hi>ſacrilegious</hi> thoughts, as to thinke <hi>God</hi> doth refuſe the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers,</hi> though they are <hi>veſſells</hi> of <hi>ſmall quantitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Boules</hi> before the <hi>Altar</hi> were counted very <hi>glorious,</hi> when it is taken for ſuch an excellent thing, for the <hi>potts</hi> in the <hi>Lords houſe,</hi> to be like unto them.

But wee quite perverting Chriſts meaning, doe in another ſenſe become little children: for ſome at firſt had no ſooner hence ſounded out this tune in our eares, that the Kingdome of heaven belongs to little children, and therefore Baptiſme: But wee all preſently, like little children, dance after this pipe, as though our heads were lighter then our heeles: and in the meane time looſe the true ſenſe, the marrow and fatneſſe of theſe Texts which ſo much doe concerne us.</p>
                  <p>And thus it is not onely in theſe Texts, but in many more, in ſo much that wee through this our childiſh (if not brutiſh) following the heard of Interpreters from humane authoritie, rather take many groſſe errours for undeniable principles, then once open our eyes to ſee and receive the truth upon Gods own bare word, that wee might beleeve, and ſo be ſaved out of this quick-ſand of deluſions: And indeed how can wee beleeve, giving and receiving honour thus one of another, and ſeek not that honour that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of God alone: As Chriſt tells us, <bibl>

            </p>
            <p>And thus you have done, <hi>not onely in theſe Texts, but in many more,</hi> as doth evidently appeare, in theſe your <hi>Childiſh Treatiſes</hi> of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if your <hi>humane Authors</hi> have made you <hi>childiſh,</hi> and <hi>brutiſh,</hi> be no more ſo; If you have followed them in ſtead of the <hi>Word,</hi> as it ſo appeareth by your citing them, in your <hi>Childiſh Treatiſes,</hi> and <hi>building</hi> upon their <hi>miſtakings; Repent</hi> then, and <hi>ſinne no more;</hi> Open your <hi>eyes,</hi> &amp; ſee the <hi>truth;</hi> Take hold of the <hi>promiſes</hi> (if it be poſſible) that you may be <hi>ſaved out of this your quick-ſand of deluſions.</hi>

You ſay, <hi>They will thus reply;</hi> Who are they that will thus reply? I thinke you have no oppoſite, in withſtanding this, except it be ſuch as your ſelfe. This may well be called <hi>ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> for it is the nature of <hi>chaffe,</hi> and <hi>ſtubble,</hi> to be ſcattered by the <hi>winde;</hi> and indeed, I thinke that this <hi>objection</hi> (which you make to be a <hi>reply</hi> of others) is your <hi>owne</hi> (if the truth were knowne.) And you might have ſaved your labour in bringing ſuch frivolous <hi>toyes.</hi> For you know, that our <hi>poynt</hi> is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning <hi>eating bread,</hi> or <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wine,</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling water,</hi> as they are <hi>meerly naturall acts,</hi> but as they are <hi>divine ordinances.</hi> Now to ſay that the <hi>eating of bread,</hi> and <hi>drinking wine,</hi> and <hi>ſprinkling water,</hi> [as they are <hi>meerly naturall acts</hi>] are <hi>divine ordinances, and that therefore whoſoever hath theſe, hath his ordinances,</hi> is very abſurd. I never did heare it proceed out of any ones mouth, nor read in any <hi>book,</hi> beſides your own. I conceive then that you might have ſaved your labour, and not made anſwer where there is no oppoſition, but have kept your <hi>Bartholomew-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> for <hi>Bartholomew-faire,</hi> unleſs you could have proved them to be the <hi>Kings Subjects,</hi> as the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>ſix moneths</hi> old are, whom you have (familiarly<note n="a" place="margin">Pag 16. lin. 1.</note> by a Suppoſition<note n="b" place="margin">Lin. 2.</note>) <hi>equalized</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Lin. 15.</note> with them in your anſwer. But herein alſo you are deceived in your <hi>judgement,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very <hi>childiſh</hi> and <hi>babiſh</hi> compariſon; For you might know (if you have the uſe of your <hi>ſenſes</hi>) that <hi>Bartholomew-babies</hi> [of the <hi>beſt ſort</hi>] are <hi>unſenſible,</hi> but [the meaneſt <hi>children</hi>] (of ſix moneths old) are <hi>reaſonable creatures,</hi> and therefore it appeareth that your <hi>unſenſible compariſons</hi> are <hi>unſeaſonable</hi> at this time.</p>
            <p>But the next <hi>objection</hi> being ſound, you cannot anſwer, but in labouring to turne it away, diſcover how deeply you are drenched in deceivable errours, and vaine conceits.</p>
            <p>The <hi>objection</hi> or <hi>poſition</hi> is, that
<q>It is ſaid <bibl>
                     <hi>(1 Cor. 10.1, 2.)</hi>
                  </bibl> of the children of Iſrael, that they were

            </p>
            <p>Your anſwer unto this is as followeth:
<q>
                  <p>The Text is, that they were all baptized unto Moſes in the cloud,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A. R.</hi> Pag. 16. li. 23.</note> and in the ſea: But our queſtion is not of baptizing unto Moſes, but of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing unto Chriſt, by being dipped or buried in water by the ſimilitude of his death, according to the inſtitution of Chriſt: Thus were not theſe Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites baptized, for they were in the cloud, and in the ſea dry, nor was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme then inſtituted; Thus then is the ſence of the place; That no enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any outward priviledge, as Baptiſme, or the Lords Supper, without true faith, companied with obedience, will now ſave us any more then the many outward priviledges &amp; viſible ſignes of Gods preſence, and the great outward deliverances which the Lord by the hand of Moſes afforded and wrought for the Iſraelites, in bringing them through the ſea, in defending and guiding them in the Wilderneſſe; by the cloud did exempt and ſave them from Gods Judgements; for notwithſtanding their enjoying all theſe outward favours, many of them periſhed in the Wilderneſſe for their ſinnes and diſobedience; which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſets out as examples unto us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here by way of alluſion compareth their outward priviledges, to the outward priviledges and ordinances of the New Teſtament; Even as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                        <hi>1 Pet. 3.20, 21.</hi>
                     </bibl> When once the long ſuffering of God, waited in the dayes of Noah, while the Arke was preparing, wherein few, that is, eight ſoules were ſaved by water; the like figure whereunto Baptiſme doth now alſo ſave us, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe then being onely figures and alluſions, cannot ſerve at all to prove the poynt in hand.</p>

            <p>The Reply.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Text</hi> doth declare they were all <hi>baptized</hi> unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>cloud,</hi> and in the <hi>ſea,</hi> is cleare, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2. And this place doth make directly againſt particular parts of your Judgement; as your denying the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of <hi>Infants</hi> to be lawfull, affirming it to be onely <hi>a meer device and tradition of men, brought into the world for poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and by-ends</hi>

Now here you may ſee who brought it into the <hi>world;</hi> I will not ſay <hi>God</hi> did it for <hi>politick or by-ends;</hi> for then I ſhould be like the <hi>Serpent,</hi> which would have perſwaded <hi>Eve</hi> that <hi>God</hi> [for ſuch by-ends] did forbid them to <hi>eat</hi> of the <hi>tree</hi> of <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>evill;</hi> thereby to poſſeſſe them with this, as though <hi>God envied</hi> their <hi>happie eſtate.</hi> But wee know that <hi>Gods love</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:111072:62"/> is not <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> his <hi>end</hi> was alwayes to doe his <hi>people good</hi> at their <hi>later end;</hi> and by the <hi>baptizing</hi> of them in the <hi>cloud</hi> and the <hi>ſea,</hi> he did <hi>prophetically</hi> demonſtrate what ſhould be in the dayes of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and herein aymed not onely at his owne <hi>glory,</hi> but at his <hi>peoples comfort.</hi>

            <p>But this <hi>Text</hi> you labour to ſhift off, by telling us, that your <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not of baptizing unto Moſes, but of baptizing unto Chriſt, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dipped or buried in water, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by this it appeareth that you think this <hi>Baptiſme</hi> which the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> received, was not the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of, (or unto) <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but meerly a <hi>Baptiſme</hi> unto <hi>Moſes.</hi> But you ſhould know that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was not ſuch a one as you take him to be; for he was <hi>faithfull</hi> in all his <hi>houſe,</hi> and brought no <hi>innovations</hi> into <hi>Gods Church.</hi> The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Oracles</hi> then, were the things of God; If then they were the things of <hi>God; Gods Sonne,</hi> who was alwayes <hi>God</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> was then the <hi>owner</hi> thereof, and he being <hi>the Angel of Gods preſence</hi>

            <p>But when you ſhould declare that our <hi>Baptiſme</hi> cannot ſave us without <hi>faith,</hi> no more then their <hi>Baptiſme</hi> could ſave them, you varie from the <hi>poynt</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> and ſpeake in <hi>generall</hi> of their <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward priviledges;</hi> and when you come to <hi>particulars,</hi> you mind their bringing through the <hi>ſea</hi> for one, their defence and guidance in the Wilderneſſe by the <hi>cloud</hi> for another; but you omit their <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> the maine thing which you ſhould keepe to at this time, and ſo you run on, and would turne <hi>Pauls</hi> particular teſtimonie, into a generall; whereas <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſpeake in particular, and telleth us, that they were <hi>baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And at length you come to <hi>Peter,</hi> and take upon you to tell us the <hi>manner</hi> of his ſpeech, how he compareth the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of the <hi>Arke,</hi> with the <hi>Baptiſme now,</hi> and ſayth, <hi>the like figure Baptiſme doth now alſo ſave us;</hi> and ſo you tell us, that <hi>theſe being onely figures and alluſions, can prove nothing to the poynt in hand.</hi> Thus now you have caſt off both the <hi>Baptiſmes</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> for the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi> now, and ſayth, this is a <hi>like figure</hi> to that, and you tell us, they are <hi>figures,</hi> and <hi>alluſions;</hi> but I thinke you mean <hi>deluſions;</hi> for you ſay, they ſerve not at all to prove the <hi>poynt</hi> in <hi>hand.</hi>

After this the</hi> Apoſtle (<hi>taught by</hi> Gods Spirit) <hi>manifeſteth the</hi> myſterie <hi>which before was kept</hi> ſecret, <hi>namely, how this paſſage under the</hi> cloud (<hi>which</hi> rained) <hi>and through the</hi> ſea, <hi>was a</hi> baptiſme <hi>to the</hi> Iſraelites: <hi>even as</hi> Chriſtian mens waſhings <hi>in</hi> rivers <hi>or</hi> veſſels, <hi>was a</hi> baptiſme <hi>to them. And as the</hi> Manna <hi>which</hi> Iſrael eat, <hi>and</hi> water <hi>from the</hi> rock <hi>which they dranke, was the ſame</hi> ſpirituall meat <hi>and</hi> drinke, <hi>which wee have ſignified by</hi> bread <hi>and</hi> wine <hi>in the</hi> Lords Supper, <hi>ſo their</hi> waſhing <hi>in the</hi> cloud <hi>and</hi> ſea, <hi>and our</hi> waſhing <hi>in</hi> veſſels <hi>or</hi> rivers, <hi>is</hi> ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>the ſame</hi> baptiſme: <hi>from hence we gather the baptizing of our</hi> Infants <hi>by two Arguments:</hi>] 1. All our fathers (<hi>ſayth</hi> Paul) were baptized
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:111072:64"/> in the cloud and ſea: <hi>therefore (ſay wee)</hi> Infants; <hi>for ſeeing there was no other</hi> baptiſme <hi>but that in the</hi> cloud <hi>and</hi> ſea, <hi>ſuch of our</hi> fathers <hi>as then were</hi> Infants, <hi>were at that time</hi> baptized, <hi>or elſe</hi> many <hi>of our</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (<hi>even</hi> all <hi>the</hi> infants <hi>of</hi> many thouſand families) <hi>were</hi> never baptized: <hi>which is contrary to the</hi> Apoſtles doctrine. <hi>And if</hi> Infants <hi>had</hi> baptiſme under Moſes, <hi>it cannot be denied them</hi> under Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In that the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>teacheth us, that the</hi> extraordinary <hi>and</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ſacraments (or ſeales of ſalvation) <hi>which</hi> Iſrael <hi>had, were the</hi> ſubſtance <hi>and</hi> truth <hi>which wee now have, though</hi> Moſes <hi>doth not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe: It followeth upon like ground, that their</hi> ordinary ſeales, <hi>namely,</hi> Circumciſion, <hi>and the</hi> Paſſeover, <hi>were the ſame in truth and ſubſtance with</hi> baptiſme, <hi>and the</hi> Lords Supper, <hi>which wee now have, and being the ſame; As</hi> Infants <hi>had</hi> Circumciſion then, <hi>ſo they are to have</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Whereas they ſay that of</hi> Moſes <hi>was called</hi> baptiſme <hi>by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, as if it were not</hi> properly baptiſme: <hi>they ſwarve from the right way: it was as truly and</hi> properly baptiſme <hi>to them, as ours is to us, though the</hi> manner <hi>of administration differ: even as their</hi> Manna <hi>and</hi> water <hi>were as truly and</hi> properly <hi>the</hi> Sacrament <hi>of</hi> Chriſts body <hi>and</hi> bloud <hi>to them, as</hi> bread <hi>and</hi> wine <hi>in the</hi> Lords Supper <hi>are to us. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>ſhould not ſay truly, that they were the ſame.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Noahs Arke <hi>is not called the</hi> figure <hi>of</hi> baptiſme, <hi>as theſe corrupters of</hi> Scripture <hi>tell us: but</hi> baptiſme (<hi>ſayth the</hi> Apoſtle) <hi>is a</hi> like figure <hi>(or antitype)</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. <hi>So that the ſaving by water of eight</hi> then <hi>in the</hi> Arke, <hi>was a</hi> type <hi>or</hi> figure: <hi>and the ſaving of a</hi> few now <hi>by</hi> water <hi>in</hi> baptiſme, <hi>is an antitype, or</hi> like figure; <hi>both of them</hi> figuring ſalvation <hi>by the</hi> death <hi>of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Neither doe theſe</hi> men <hi>ſet downe the</hi> reaſon <hi>fully and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why they are ſayd to be</hi> baptized, <hi>(namely,) becauſe the</hi> cloud <hi>and</hi> ſea <hi>was their ſafetie, as</hi> Noahs Arke <hi>was,) for though it may in ſome ſenſe be granted, that theſe were their ſafetie, as</hi> baptiſme <hi>is our ſafetie, (for it is ſaid to ſave us,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21.) <hi>yet properly they are ſayd to be</hi> baptized <hi>in the</hi> cloud <hi>and</hi> ſea, <hi>becauſe they were in them</hi> ſacramentally waſhed <hi>from their</hi> ſinnes, <hi>and</hi> planted together in the likeneſſe of his death, buriall, and reſurrection, <hi>as wee are now by</hi> baptiſme, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> cloud <hi>ſerved them for</hi> three uſes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To protect and keep them ſafe,</hi> Iſa. 4.5.6.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:111072:65"/>2. <hi>To guide them in the way that they ſhould goe,</hi> Numb. 9.17 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Exod. 14.21. <hi>And theſe two were</hi> ordinary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To</hi> baptize <hi>them by powring downe</hi> water, <hi>and this was</hi> extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, <hi>and but</hi> one time <hi>in the</hi> red Sea, <hi>for ought wee finde. And in this reſpect</hi> Paul <hi>ſayth, they were</hi> baptized <hi>in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Their laſt ſpeech of injoyning</hi> infants <hi>to ſuffer</hi> perſecution, <hi>as well as to</hi> baptize <hi>them, is ſpoken with a wry mouth: for as we injoyne not</hi> Infants <hi>to be</hi> baptized, <hi>though we</hi> baptize <hi>them; ſo can wee not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne them to</hi> ſuffer perſecution. <hi>But this wee ſay and know, as</hi> Infants <hi>are</hi> baptized <hi>into</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ſo oftentimes they</hi> ſuffer perſecution <hi>for</hi> Chriſt, <hi>being with their</hi> parents afflicted, impriſoned, baniſhed, <hi>&amp;c. yea, and bereaved of</hi> life <hi>it ſelfe, ſo that they have even the</hi> baptiſme <hi>of</hi> bloud <hi>or</hi> martyrdome <hi>alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee, that there hath been (long agoe) a large and ſufficient <hi>Anſwer</hi> made unto this <hi>Anſwer</hi> of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> of <hi>old,</hi> which is even one and the ſame with yours.</p>
            <p>Thus much for reply to your <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>third objection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As touching the <hi>fourth</hi> &amp; <hi>fifth objection</hi> (the charitable conſtruction being ſet aſide) I except againſt them <hi>both;</hi> but eſpecially the <hi>fourth;</hi> that the <hi>outward baptiſme</hi> is not needful to him that hath the<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 17. lin. 8.</note> other.

               <note n="*" place="margin">Lin. 19.</note>, which is, that <hi>Baptiſme is nothing, (though it may beare a charitable conſtruction) yet if any conceive</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme <hi>is nothing,</hi> as it is an <hi>ordinance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they erre.

            <p>But whoſoever the <hi>Authors</hi> are, you call this <hi>their maine argument,</hi> and it may be you count it ſo, becauſe it is generally layd downe, and undiſtinguiſhed; and I tell you, though the matter may be the <hi>Seperates,</hi> yet the forme is not, but rather your own; for it is <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſticall</hi> to infer, that becauſe the <hi>covenant</hi> and <hi>promiſes</hi> were made to <hi>Abrahams ſeed</hi> before the <hi>Law,</hi> that thereupon all his <hi>ſeed</hi> were <hi>circumciſed</hi> in the time of the <hi>Law;</hi> if by <hi>[all]</hi> you mean all his ſeed by <hi>generation</hi> after the <hi>fleſh;</hi> for then it will follow, that all <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> were <hi>circumciſed,</hi> and all other <hi>Apoſtates</hi> of <hi>Abrahams ſeed</hi> by <hi>generation,</hi> beſides the reſt of his <hi>ſeed:</hi> But wee doe affirme, and will prove, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> had no command to <hi>Circumciſe all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (or <hi>ſeeds,</hi> or any <hi>Apoſtate</hi> whatſoever, though the <hi>off-ſpring</hi> of his <hi>body</hi>) but thoſe that were <hi>the ſeed</hi> in <hi>covenant</hi> with <hi>God</hi>

            <p>To this I anſwer, That we may well ground this, from the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that, though we are not tyed to obſerve that in every thing.

            </p>
            <p>To this I reply; That this which you have ſaid, proveth not at all, that <hi>infants</hi> were caſt out; There is not one tittle of <hi>Scripture</hi> in all the <hi>New</hi> or <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> to this purpoſe, that the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers</hi> are, (or ſhall be) caſt out; Bring me one Inſtance, if you can, of any one <hi>infant</hi> of a <hi>beleever,</hi> that at <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming was to be caſt out, &amp; then you will ſay ſomething for their exempting out of the <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> but as yet you have brought none, neither can you finde any, but many, yea, multitudes of Scripture there are to the contrary, both in the <hi>new</hi> and <hi>old Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you ſeem to poynt out the time when the holy <hi>infants</hi> were caſt out of the <hi>Church;</hi> You tell us, they <hi>were caſt out when the Jewes Church-ſtate, and old covenant was abrogated by the coming of Chriſt, and preaching of the Goſpel, and planting other Churches, farre different from that of the Jewes in many reſpects.</hi> But alas, you take for granted, a thing which you have not proved, and it is no marvaile indeed, to ſee the thing that is not probable, to be without proofe. That the <hi>Jewes Church-ſtate</hi> was <hi>abrogated</hi> with the <hi>old covenant,</hi> I am not bound to <hi>beleeve,</hi> except I ſee it in <hi>Gods Word,</hi> much leſſe will I grant, that the <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> overthrew the <hi>Church-ſtate.</hi> But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>new Jeruſalem hath gates and foundations,</hi>

            <p>And now I will proceed to examine the <hi>Scriptures</hi> which you have cited heer, for confirmation of theſe your opinions.</p>
            <p>As touching <hi>Rom</hi> 2.28, 29. there the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> declareth who are the true <hi>Jewes</hi> indeed, (namely) thoſe that are <hi>Jewes</hi> inwardly; and that the <hi>true Circumciſion</hi> indeed, is that of the <hi>heart,</hi> in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> not in the <hi>letter, whoſe praiſe is of God, &amp;c.</hi> Now will you reaſon from this place, that thoſe who were the <hi>naturall ſeed</hi> (not degenerating) were
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:111072:79"/> not the <hi>ſpirituall ſeed?</hi> and that becauſe <hi>God</hi> accepted of the <hi>infants</hi> with their <hi>parents,</hi> and commanded them to be <hi>circumciſed,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> was built upon <hi>nature,</hi> and not upon <hi>Christ!</hi> Surely you cannot gather any ſuch thing from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. nor from any other place of Scripture, but rather the contrary. Yea, the <hi>Apostle</hi> in the following Chapter declareth, that as for the <hi>advantage</hi> of <hi>the Jew,</hi> and the <hi>profit</hi> of <hi>circumciſion,</hi> it was <hi>much every manner of way; chiefly becauſe that unto them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God: For</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>what if ſome did not beleeve, ſhall their unbeliefe make the faith of God without effect? God forbid:</hi> And ſo he concludeth, that both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are <hi>juſtified by faith; Seeing it is one God which ſhall juſtifie the circumciſion by faith, and the uncircumciſion through faith; Doe wee then make voyd the Law through faith?</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>God forbid: yea, wee eſtabliſh the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the fourth Chapter <hi>Paul</hi> treateth of <hi>juſtification by faith without workes;</hi> and expoundeth <hi>Davids</hi> ſpeech; for whereas <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſayth<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 32.1, 2.</note>, <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not ſinne, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.

            <p>It may be you thinke thus; That <hi>if the Church of Iſrael were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of free-men, why then were many of them manifeſted afterwards to be wicked?

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If this be any ground of your prejudicacie againſt the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> then let this ſatisfie you, that theſe were <hi>free-men</hi> at firſt, according to <hi>viſibilitie,</hi> as <hi>holy</hi> as <hi>Judas,</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira;</hi> And therefore if it be an <hi>argument</hi> of a <hi>falſe conſtitution,</hi> for <hi>members</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to fall from their <hi>ſtedfaſtneſſe,</hi> then it will follow, that the <hi>Church</hi> now (under the <hi>Goſpel</hi>) hath not a true <hi>conſtitution,</hi> ſeeing that divers fall from their <hi>ſtedfaſtneſſe,</hi> ſome for a time, like the <hi>inceſtuous perſon</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> others, finally, totally, and eternally, like <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Lambs twelve Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this then be the concluſion, that the ſtate may be a ſtate of <hi>free-men,</hi> though ſome <hi>bond-men</hi> appeare in it, and are caſt out, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the <hi>ſonne</hi> of the <hi>bond-woman,</hi> was caſt out of the ſtate of <hi>free-men,</hi> wherein the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers</hi> were admitted, though they were not the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh.</hi>

            <p>Wee have cauſe to bewaile their <hi>ignorance,</hi> who pretend <hi>holineſſe</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and make a <hi>verball profeſſion,</hi> drawing neer unto <hi>God</hi> with their <hi>mouthes</hi> (like the <hi>Apoſtate Iſraelites</hi>) when their <hi>hearts</hi> are far from him; pleading for the <hi>baptizing</hi> of thoſe <hi>Infants,</hi> whoſe <hi>parents</hi> are neither of them <hi>beleevers,</hi> cauſing the <hi>holy ſigne</hi> to be <hi>adminiſtred</hi> upon their <hi>infants</hi> in that <hi>idolatrous eſtate;</hi> in the partaking whereof, they have no <hi>right,</hi> any more then the <hi>ſeed</hi> of thoſe <hi>Apoſtates</hi> of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> had <hi>right</hi> to <hi>circumciſion</hi> in former time.</p>

As for thoſe that <hi>beleeved,</hi> their <hi>priviledges</hi> and <hi>prerogatives</hi> were ſtill as great, and as large, both to them, and their <hi>ſeed,</hi> as they were before.

            <p>And theſe interrogations of yours, are anſwered at large, you having mentioned the ſame things before.</p>
            <p>Againe, You ſay;

            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That this hath been anſwered before already, It hath been proved ſufficiently, that the ſame <hi>covenant</hi> which was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>ſeed,</hi> is made to <hi>beleevers</hi> and their <hi>ſeed;</hi> &amp; it being a perpetuall <hi>covenant,</hi> the <hi>heires</hi> of it are perpetuall <hi>heires,</hi> even ſuch to whom the <hi>promiſes</hi> doe appertaine, as well as unto their deare brethren of old, who are departed in the ſame faith; and this <hi>heavenly</hi> order the <hi>old Law</hi> which was given at <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> could not diſanull.</p>
            <p>And I hope there is no reaſonable man, but will condeſcend unto this, that all thoſe who were to receive the <hi>ſigne</hi> and <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
